# Red Black Tree in Rust

[![Tests](https://github.com/chocolacula/rb_tree/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chocolacula/rb_tree/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

It's educational project, made with one purpose - teach students algorithms and RustðŸ¦€.  

It covers basic Rust topics like borrowing and includes:

- `cargo` commands
- project structure
- testing
- standard modules like `Option<>` and `Result<>`
- interior mutability and `Rc<RefCell<>>`
- `unsafe` code

The code is not optimal, it has written in easy to read manner instead.  

A few notes about implementation:

- `RbTree<T>` has only `key` which is `value` in the same time
- implements `print()` for rendering tree structure in console
- implements `is_valid()` for checking rules violation
- nevertheless has a few optimizations:
  - build path during traversal instead of store pointer to parent
  - store children in small array to reduce branching

Moreover it contains good comments which covers rotation and colorization.

If you're not even a student but have problems understanding, feel free to contact me for explanation.
